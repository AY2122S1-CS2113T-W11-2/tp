### <a name="sys-arch"></a>System Architecture

![](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The above **System Architecture** diagram shows the high-level design of Mint.

On launch, the `Main` class initialises the app components in the correct sequence and links them up with each other, in
the correct sequence.

Apart from `Main`, Mint comprises six main components, namely:

- `Ui`: The UI of the App 
- `Logic`: Make sense of user input and execute command
- `Model`: Holds the data of the App
- `DataManager`: Reads from and writes to [`LocalStorage`](#local-storage).

The components interact with each other, as shown in the sequence diagram below.

### <a name="model"></a>Model
##### <a name="finance"></a>Finance
![](images/Finance.png)
#### <a name="budget"></a>Budget
![](images/Budget.png)

The `Budget` package consists of a `BudgetManager` and the `Budget`'s each of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.
- `Budget` is an abstract class
- `XYZBudget`(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specified budget e.g., `FoodBudget`), inherits `Budget` and its attributes.
- `BudgetManager` stores a list of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.
- Currently, `BudgetManager` only interacts in 2 ways
    - when user want to set budget for a specific category
    - when other parts of the app requires the list of budgets e.g., `Ui` needs the list to print to the user, or `FinanceManager` needs to know if the user is nearing their spending limit to notify them.

### <a name="contact-list"></a>ExpenseList

### <a name="storage"></a>DataManager

**How the `Storage` component works:**

**1. Loading the lists from the stored files:**

![](images/StorageLoadFiles.png)
> For ease of visualization, since the logic for all the different lists are the same, we have broken it down to show
> one example using the diagram

1. When the program is executed, all the objects including the `BudgetDataManager`, `DataManagerActions`, 
   `NormalListDataManager` and `RecurringListDataManager` would be created. 
2. The programme would then load all the stored content from the lists which records the user's previously recorded
   normal expenditure, recurring expenditure, and the spending limits they set for each category.
3. Upon detection, missing text files, and the required directory would be created.

**2. General logic for each command:**

![](images/Storage.png)

1. After the command is extracted from the `Parser`, `Duke` would call the respective command class. In the case of
   the add function, the `AddCommand` class would be called.
2. In the `AddCommand` class, after the add command has been successfully performed, a method call to 
   `appendToEntryListTextFile` would activate the `NormalListDataManager` class for which the added entry would be 
   appended to an external text file.
   
**The `Storage` component:**
1. Can save all the `recurringEntryList`, `budgetList` and the `entryList` in a text file. It is also able to read the 
   data from the respective text files and read them back into the corresponding objects.
2. Has four different classes. `DataManagerActions` comprises the common components used by the other two classes,
   `BudgetListDataManager`, `RecurringListDataManager` and `NormalListDataManager`. All of these classes inherit from 
   the `DataManagerActions` class.

- Should work on any [*mainstream Operating Systems*](#os) as long as Java `11` or higher has been installed on it.
- Each command (Add, delete, edit, view) should be executed within 1 second of the user input.

### :heavy_plus_sign: <a name="Adding"></a>Adding an expense

**Prerequisites**

- The list must have been initialized.
  <br/>
  
**Test case 1: Adding an expense with all fields specified.**

**Usage:**

- `add a/[amount] n/[description] d/[date] c/[categoryNumber]` 
- Some fields such as `n/[description] a/[amount]` must be specified. If the user prefers,
  additional fields can be added for greater specificity. The fields can be specified in any order.

**Expected**

- Program would print a message to notify the user that the item has been added.
- An expense would then be added to the list.
- Optional fields that are missing would be set to the default pre-determined by the program.

**Example of usage and expected output:**

```
add a/15 d/2021-12-03 n/Textbook c/7
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I've added: Expense  | OTHERS | 2021-12-03 | Textbook | $15.00
