### <a name="sys-arch"></a>System Architecture

![](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The above **System Architecture** diagram shows the high-level design of Mint.

On launch, the `Main` class initialises the app components in the correct sequence and links them up with each other, in
the correct sequence.

Apart from `Main`, Mint comprises six main components, namely:

- `Ui`: The UI of the App
- `Parser`: Extracts user command and relevant queries.
- `Command`: Execute user command
- `Finances`: Holds data of user's finances.
- `Budget`: Holds data of user's budget.
- `DataManager`: Reads from and writes to [`LocalStorage`](#local-storage).

The four main components interact with each other, as shown in the sequence diagram below. { NEED SEQUENCE DIAGRAM }

#### <a name="budget"></a>Budget



### <a name="contact-list"></a>ExpenseList

### <a name="storage"></a>DataManager

![](images/storage.png)

How the `Storage` component works:

1. When the program is executed, the `DataManagerActions` object would be created 
2. It would then load both the expense list, and the category list from the `ExpenseListDataManager` and the 
   `CategoryListDataManager`. 
3. The expense list, and the category list stores the user's previously recorded expenditure, and the spending limits 
   set by the user respectively.
4. Upon detection, missing text files would be created.

The `Storage` component: 
1. Can save both the `categoryList`, and the `expenseList` in a text file. It is also able to read the data from the 
   respective text files and read them back into the corresponding objects.
2. Has three different classes. `DataManagerActions` comprises the common components used by the other two classes,
   `CategoryListDataManager` and `ExpenseListDataManager`. 
   Both of these classes inherit from the `DataManagerActions` class.
3. Depends on the `ExpenseList`, `Expense` and `CategoryList` class as its job is to save/retreive objects that belong 
   to the aforementioned classes.

- Should work on any [*mainstream Operating Systems*](#os) as long as Java `11` or higher has been installed on it.
- Each command (Add, delete, edit, view) should be executed within 1 second of the user input.
- Users can use the application throughout the week at any time during the day. In the case of unexpected downtime, all
  features will be available again within 24 hours.
- If the commands have errors, they can be fixed within 24 hours.

### :heavy_plus_sign: <a name="Adding"></a>Adding an expense

**Prerequisites**

- The list must have been initialized.
- Some fields such as `n/[description] a/[amount]` must be specified. If the user prefers,
  additional tags can be added for greater specificity.

**Test case 1: Adding an existing expense with all fields specified.**

**Usage:**

- `add a/[amount] n/[description] d/[date] c/[categoryNumber]` in any order

**Expected**

- Program would print a message to notify the user that the item has been added.
- An expense would then be added to the list

**Example of usage and expected output:**

```
add a/15 d/2021-12-03 n/Textbook c/0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I've added :Expense |       FOOD       | 2021-12-03 |     Textbook     |-$15.00
```
**Test case 2: Adding an existing expense with some fields specified.**

**Usage:**

- `add a/[amount] n/[description] d/[date]` in any order
- `add a/[amount] n/[description] c/[catNum]` in any order
- `add a/[amount] n/[description` in any order

**Expected**

- Program would print a message to notify the user that the item has been added.
- An expense would then be added to the list
- Optional fields that are missing would be set to the default pre-determined by the programme

**Example of usage and expected output:**

```
add a/15 d/2021-12-03 n/Textbook
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I've added :Expense |       FOOD       | 2021-12-03 |     Textbook     |-$15.00
```
```
add a/5 n/Chicken Rice c/0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I've added :Expense |       FOOD       | 2021-10-26 |   Chicken Rice   |-$5.00
```
```
add n/Cheese Burger a/23.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I've added :Expense |      OTHERS      | 2021-10-26 |  Cheese Burger   |-$23.50
```

### :x: <a name="delete"></a>Deleting an expense

**Prerequisites**

- The list must have expenses that have already been added.
- At least one field must be specified. If the user prefers, additional tags can be added for greater
  specificity.

**Test case 1: Deleting an existing expense with some fields specified. Only one expense
exists that matches all the fields specified.**

**Usage:**

- `delete [include some fields of the expense you would like to delete]`

**Expected**

- It asks user if the user wants to delete the found expense.
- If user inputs y, it deletes. If user inputs n, it exits the delete process.

**Example of usage and expected output:**

```
delete n/Movie c/7
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Is this what you want to delete?
    Others | 2021-10-19 | Movie | $12.00
Type "y" if yes. Type "n" if not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
y
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I have deleted: Others | 2021-10-19 | Movie | $12.00
```
**Test case 2: Choosing not to delete an existing expense after entering the delete command.**

**Usage:**

- `delete a/[amount] n/[description]` in any order. If the user prefers,
   additional tags can be added for greater specificity.
- When prompted, input 'n' to cancel delete.

**Expected**

- It asks user if the user wants to delete the found expense.
- When user inputs n, it exits the delete process.

**Example of usage and expected output:**

```
delete a/90 d/2021-12-03 n/phone bills c/3 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Is this what you want to delete?
    Expense |    HOUSEHOLD     | 2021-12-03 |   phone bills    |-$90.00
Type "y" if yes. Type "n" if not.

Ok. I have cancelled the process.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
n
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok. I have cancelled the process.
```

### :writing_hand: <a name="edit"></a>Editing an expense

**Prerequisites**

- The list must have expenses that have already been added.

  specificity.

**Usage:**

- `edit [include all fields of expense you would like to edit]`
- `a/[amount] n/[description] c/[catNum] d/[validDate]`

**Expected**
